A citizen of Aundair, born in the small town of Bluevine, a farming community in the breadbasket of the country... Killian was never satisfied with the idea of carrying on the farming tradition of his aunt and uncle, with whom he had lived since his parents had disappeared while he was still a young boy.

On Killian’s eleventh birthday, he was visited by an owl messenger from the Floating Towers Arcanix, home to the Arcane Congress and to Hogwart’s, one of the premier schools of wizardry in all the land. Killian’s family was reluctant to let him go, but the next day, a very large man, the Head Groundskeeper at Hogwarts, showed up and convinced them that it would be in their best interest to let young Killian go.

Upon arriving at Arcanix, Killian met with Raulo ir’Trannick, the Lord Mayor of Arcanix and a member of the Arcane Congress. Raulo and other members of the Trannick family are the proctors of the Autumn Entrance Exams, determining which of Aundair’s brightest will get a chance to become magewrights and wizards.  Apparently, Raulo knew Killian’s parents and had agreed to bring him to Hogwart’s if anything ever happened to them.

Killian rarely saw Raulo after that initial meeting- unfortunately, it was most often when the Lord Mayor would step in to save Killian from severe disciplinary action by certain Hogwart’s professors.  His academic career was both adventurous and successful, but one particular goal was left unfinished... he never found out anything more substantive about his parents.  His uncle always told him that they were crewmembers on a spice freighter on Lake Galifar.  Raulo scoffed derisively at that assertion, but would share no more.

Upon finishing school at eighteen, Killian went immediately into the Aundarian army to train to join the ranks of Aundar’s elite warrior wizards, the Knights Phantom and went to war. He participated in many battles against Thrane and Karrnath.  After years of hard work and weapons training, Killian finally gained the rank of Knight Phantom... just in time for the end of the war.

Much of the army was deactivated, leaving Killian to find his way as an adventurer, always willing to storm the castle, slay the dragon, find the treasure and perhaps...just perhaps, save a damsel-in-distress... or two.
