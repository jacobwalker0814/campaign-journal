Before we discuss the half-orc that  will come to be known as Skytalon, we must first understand his origins.

The Greyskull tribe was once a flourishing band of hunter-gatherers that coexisted well with their human neighbors, at least until the humans began to expand. They drove away the game, chopped down the trees, and plundered the land ruthlessly. The orcs had little choice but to retaliate, and were all but decimated for their efforts. Having lost nearly all of their males, the remainder of the tribe migrated west, and were forced to breed with humans or die out.

Among his primarily half-orcish peers, Grom was perpetually set apart for his weak stomach and aversion to blood (FLAW: Weak fortitude). This weakness continued throughout his upbringing, and eventually he swore off the martial arts altogether. 

His training halted, Grom quickly found himself to be valueless to his tribe, until he discovered his true calling: a way to fight that did not involve the gore and terror of melee. He began to study the use of javelins exclusively, and became quite skilled. (FEATS: Point Blank Shot, Brutal Throw). 

Despite his aversion to blood, which as he grew had caused him to forsake meat and fish, his orcish blood ran strong in his veins, and when he entered his rage it was fearsome to behold. (FEAT: Reckless Rage)

Eventually his fellow warriors accepted his strange style, though they encouraged his continued practice on his aim (FEAT: Precise Shot).
