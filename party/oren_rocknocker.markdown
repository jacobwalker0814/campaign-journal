Oren is the youngest of the five sons of Thoren Rocknocker III and Rosey Lynn Rocknocker. Thoren was Captain of Valor’s Shield (the king’s guard) and Rosey was a cleric of The Sovereign Host. He is named after King Oren Shatterhelm IV of Citadel Valanarn. The story behind the name is stuff of legend.

When Oren was still in Rosey’s womb, an army of Goblinoids led by Orcs and Orges raided the main Dwarven mine of Citadel Valarn. The area in which the mine was located was known as “Fallen Sky”. There was an enormous cater next to the mine, created when the sky fell from the heavens and landed to the earth. The ore and minerals in this area is some of the richest in the land and has been fought over more times than can be told. The greatest of these battles is simply known as “The Battle of Fallen Sky Cater”. Dwarves and Orcs still sing of songs of heroism from this day. King Oren Shattehelm led the Dwarven army himself and of course he was surrounded by all members of Valor’s Shield.

The Orc army split the Dwarven army in two and had the king and his Shield surrounded. Thoren and his brother Korlen fought next to their king. The members of the Shield were dying all around the brothers and their king until it was just the three of them left. The king eventually sustained enough wounds and he fell to the ground and yet the Rocknocker brothers stood their ground taking wounds that would have fallen the most warriors. Korlen finally fell unconscious to the ground, overcome by all of the wounds that he sustained. Thoren stood and fought on protecting his brother and king. Finally, the main army broke through the ranks of Orcs, Goblins, and Ogres and reached their king. Once Thoren saw his brethren and knew that his king was safe, he dropped to the ground, closed his eyes and never opened them again. The only ones to survive that attack were King Oren and Korlen Rocknocker. However the king was mortally wounded and was carried to his deathbed where he made one final request.

He knew that Rosey was in labor as he laid dying in his deathbed. He sent word back to her telling her how valiant her husband was and how he gave his life protecting his king and brother. King Oren’s request was that he asked Rosey if he could have the honor of passing his name to her newly born child.

She accepted and Oren Rocknocker was born.

Legend has it that King Oren died the exact moment that Oren Rocknocker was born. There is no way of truly knowing this, but that’s how legends are. King Oren never did know if Rosey accepted his request.

-------------------------------------------

Oren’s brothers are Thoren IV, the twins Boren and Doren, and Koren.

Thoren became a cleric of Balinor. His father didn’t approve of his choice of gods, so he was hence forth known as Thorn to his father because he was always a Thorn in his side. The elder Thoren always felt that Balinor was a god suited for the Elven folk and not suitable for likes of Dwarves.

Boren and Doren became great warriors. Their Uncle Korlen reformed Valor’s Shield and both twins were selected to serve in The Shield. Rosey couldn’t stand the thought of both sons being in the guard, so Doren honorably declined the offer to join the Shield, while Boren is still among the honorable Shield to this day serving proudly next his uncle.

Koren made one of the more unusual choices of all especially for a dwarf. After his father was killed, he decided to join the monastery and became a monk of great renown. He is currently walking the earth allowing his feet and heart to take him where he needs to go.

Oren of course became a cleric of Dol Arrah. He felt the call to serve her for as long as he could remember until it became too irresistible. He has often thought about the father he never knew and how fitting it was to serve the goddess of  Honorable Combat and Self-Sacrifice. He knows in his heart that it was Dol Arrah who gave his father the strength to stand when all others would have fallen much sooner to the wounds that he sustained.

He tries to keep in touch with his family the best that he can. Thoren is the one he communicates with the most since they are both part of “the Plate” so the clerics say. Thoren loves talking about a boisterous Halfling cleric that he has met in his journeys. The Halfling of course spreads the word of his own faith, and Thoren just calls him “Brooks”. Oren can never remember the Halfling’s full name. The stories seem to have originated from an Elf, that Brooks just calls Uncle Cal and they always revolve around Uncle Cal and two other Halflings which happen to be his father and distant cousin, Gar and Bar. But those tales are of another time and of another place.
