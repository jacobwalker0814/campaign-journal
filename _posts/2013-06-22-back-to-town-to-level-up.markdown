# Day 4
## Back to Town
Having evicted the squatters at Vraath Keep our heroes made their way back to town. They arrived late in the evening and, being rather sleepy, they went to bed.

# Day 5
Over the inn's free continental breakfast the party was debriefed by Speaker Wiston and Captain Soranna. Through mouthfuls of scrambled eggs and waffles shaped like Elsir Vale our heroes wove the tale of their victory over the bugbear sorcerer. They ended their breakfast meeting by presenting the map they found along with a dire and ominous warning of the potential aggression to come.

The rest of the party left while {{ killian }} stayed behind to catch up with his beloved Captain Soranna. It turns out that she had become quite enamored and was rather worried about her boo.

Being savvy shoppers the party identified the magic items in their booty, divvied up loot and sold the extra stuff. After that everyone took some time to do their own things.

## Rumors of War
Being generally alcoholic layabouts, the party started drinking shortly after their shopping trip and was still drinking in the afternoon when a dusty rider came through the inn's door capturing everyone's attention. Garbed in a blue soldier's tunic emblazoned with a stylized lion the woman was identified by the locals as a "Lion of Brindol" (an elite soldier in Brindol's Lion Guard).

After wetting her whistle she introduce herself as Teyani Sura and called for the town speaker. Captain Soranna was already present giggling in the corner with {{ killian }}. When the speaker arrived Teyani delivered her warning. A few days past her patrol encountered a roadblock of hobgoblins and ogres blocking the Rhest Trail. Besides the Dawn Way, the Rhest Trail is the primary northern access road to the vale. Teyani and several others were dispatched to towns in the region to warn travelers to avoid the road.

Having delivered her warning the party rebutted with their own. Teyani promptly left to deliver the dire news to Brindol.

## Pow! Right in the Pooper!
After a light dinner {{ killian }} and Captain Soranna are out for a romantic moonlit stroll. They were having a beautiful moment when the serene night was split by piercing screams. Goblins riding Worgs were raiding the town. The greenskin scoundrels were rampaging down a road starting leaving burning buildings in their wake.

The party quickly came to {{ killian}}'s rallying cry. The Word riders had no chance against our valiant heroes. The highlight of the battle came when {{ mr_fabulous }} stabbed a Word in the heart... by way of his anus. His rapier would never smell quite the same after that.

# Day 6
## A Tense Situation
Being the quietly charismatic one in the group, {{ jeff }} went before the town council. Through much heated debate and a moving oration Jeff convinced the council to send riders to Brindol and all towns along the way carrying a warning of the impending doom.

## Here There be Dragons
Feeling that he had yet to really contribute to the party {{ gerbert }} offered to scout out the situation up north. With a druidic flare his bones warped, his skin sprouted feathers, and his mouth elongated into a beak. Within seconds {{ gerbert }} was in the form of a hawk. Rising up on the winds he took wing and flew north towards the enemy.

# Day 7
## Chimeras attack!
{{ oren }} uses one of the charges from the Staff of Life on {{ killian }}

# Session Wrap-Up
Proving to be incredibly useful, {{ gerbert }} advances to level 7!
Also {{ zevy }} leveled up to 7
