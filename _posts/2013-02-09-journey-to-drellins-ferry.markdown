# Background
The aforementioned characters, hereafter referred to as "the party," have a long history together that predates this campaign. Most of that history involves Mr. Fabulous performing shady deeds, Jeff the Warlock saving Oren RocKnocker's life and Killian Gerlach telling everyone what to do. The specifics details of those adventures will not be found here but would probably be learned over a mug of ale.

During those epic encounters the party caught wind of tales of a treasure in an abandoned keep near the southern town of Drellin's Ferry. With visions of gold, conquests, ale, and a hero's reputation the party set forth from the major city of Brindol upon the merchant road "The Dawn's Way" bound for Drellin's Ferry.

# Day 1
## On the Road Again

The trip to Drellin's Ferry was mostly uneventful. Stormy used her archery prowess to hunt game for the party's feasts and Gerbert convinced the local fauna to gather nuts and berries for some delectable side dishes.

## Ambush!

When the party was a half day's walk from their destination things finally got interesting. Overconfident and off their guard from their peaceful travels, our heroes were caught in an ambush! As they rounded a corner (as in all good ambushes) a dozen hobgoblins sprung from the bushes. Once their initial shock wore off the party hastily brandished their weapons and prepared to defend themselves with deadly force.

Unfortunately for our heroes this was no meager ambush of hobgoblins alone. The gobbos were accompanied by several hell hounds and as the fight erupted more portals to the lower planes opened and more hell hounds burst forth. The party showed that just as this was no normal ambush, they were no normal ambushees. When it became clear to the assailants that their prey would be no easy meat the leaders of the bandits emerged. Two elite hobgoblin blade-masters set in to the travelers with equal parts flourish and fervor.

Despite the significant threat posed by the bandits, the party was able to hold their own. Tim the Warmage flung exploding fireballs about the battlefield like an angry impressionist painter flicking paint at a canvas. As fire served him well, Tim continued with this theme and sent impressive orbs of fire rolling along the enemies' ranks. Stormy and Skytalon darkened the sky with arrows and javelins, raining death from above and the hobgoblins were left without umbrellas. Oren called on the power of his diety to bless his allies and curse his enemies. Gerbert took the shape of a predatory beast and feasted on hobgoblin flesh. Killian directed his allies and let loose with magic missiles. Mr Fabulous efficiently dispatched enemies in the manner that he prefers: from behind.

As the battle was coming to a close a new goblin appeared on the field but this greenskin was playing on the side of the good guys. As a large bandit's sword began its descent above Oren's head to deliver what would have surely otherwise been a lethal blow, Jeff the Warlock let loose a blast of pure eldritch power which ripped the hobgoblin apart and saved Oren's life yet again.

The most significant threat came when Stormy was waylaid by an invisible assailant. As she reached for her quiver she felt a sudden shock overtake her body and she was instantly paralyzed. The resulting frozen pose was both humorous and scandalous. Her invisible assailant was not content with simply removing her from battle. As the last of the hobgoblins was falling the attacker decided to take someone out for good. With a measured blow to the back of her head Stormy was brought within an inch of death. Killian cast a spell to grant himself enhanced sight which revealed to him an evil hobgoblin cleric of Tiamat. As the cleric fled, and at Killian's pointed direction, Tim the Warmage cast another fireball into the woods and managed to fry the evil priest.

## Boars, Boars, Boars!

With their enemies defeated the party began to lick their wounds. Oren and Gerbert spent their magics to heal their allies and with the passage of time Stormy's spell of paralysis abated.

As the party traveled the remaining distance to Drellin's Ferry they heard a strange noise coming from the woods near the trail. It grew louder and louder. With sudden clarity it was revealed to the party as a stampeding horde of Dire Boars! The party had no time to consider what might have spooked the boars into charging; they only had time to fend for their lives.

Tim the Warmage met his untimely end upon the tusks of one of the boars. With animal furor the dire beast spread Tim's entrails about the ground like silly string at a child's birthday party. The gory site was too much for Skytalon's delicate constitution and he quickly lost his lunch.

## Arrival in Drellin's Ferry
The surviving members of the party wearily made their way to Drellin's Ferry. They were stopped by suspicious guards as they entered the town. Apparently there had been many recent encounters with green skinned bandits and the local militia was on alert. At word of the party's victory over their hobgoblin attackers the guards welcomed the party in as heroes. The guards have our heroes directions to the Old Bridge Inn where they acquired rooms and sufficient ale to honor their fallen comrade Tim the Warmage, who was picked over for party loot and unceremoniously left scattered about the road a few miles outside of town.

Shortly after their arrival at the Old Bridge Inn the party was introduced to the Town Speaker, Norro Wiston, and Soranna the Captain of the Guard. These representatives of the town had heard word (probably exaggerated word) of the party's exploits and wished to impose upon them. They explained that the town had recently been plagued by skirmishes and encounters with roving bands of hobgoblins. They impressed upon the party to search out and eliminate this threat to their town's wellbeing. For a small sum of money the party agreed.

Now it should be noted at this time that when Killian and Soranna met eyes there was an instant, mutual, and strong attraction. Like a budding rose, neither dared speak of it lest they risk damaging its delicate petals.

During this conversation the party learned of a keep formally of the expired House of Vrath in the forest outside of town called the Witchwood. The party surmised that this keep was probably the location of the rumored treasure that brought them to this region initially. Freshly charged with the defense of the town and with a lead on their fabled treasure the party made plans to set forth in the morning.
