# Retcon of Last Session
Before arriving in Drellin's Ferry it was decided that {{ skytalon }} should make camp in the woods outside of town rather than risk an all too familiar and unwanted encounter with the town guards. People in this region are not known for their tolerance for people of color, specifically the color green.

Rather than feel stifled by the wooden walls of the Old Bridge Inn, {{ gerbert }} opted to seek out and stay with the druid Avarthel at The Old Ones. During their visit they fell into such a stimulating conversation that {{ gerbert }} forgot to rejoin the party for this session's adventure.

While resting their weary feet with an evening drink on their first night in the Old Bridge Inn the party found a hairy, snoring drunk lump of metal and stone on the ground under a tapped and drained keg. Upon further inspection this lump was found to be the dwarf {{ zevy }}. When he eventually awoke he was welcomed into the party and invited to join them on their expedition to Vraath Keep.

# Day 2
Freshly rested (but slightly hungover) and eager to slay any man or beast that dared stand between them and treasure, the party set forth into the Witchwood in search of Vraath Keep.

## Into the Witchwood

The Witchwood is a warm forest with a mix of oaks, sub-tropical evergreens, and plenty of undergrowth. The party traveled along the Dawn Way until it intersected with the Witch Trail. They hung a right on that footpath seeking a trapper they were told might help them in finding their quarry. After a good hike they came upon a ramshackle cabin near a dark bayou.

Approaching the cabin summoned three large and ferocious hunting dogs from under the porch in defense of their master's homestead. Fortunately the party was able to restrain their own vicious nature and held back any attack on the canines. As the dogs bayed their warning a very leathery man with a longbow knocked came out to meet the intruders. The man introduced himself as Jorr, the trapper the party sought. After much drawling and anti-goblinoid hate speech Jorr agreed to show the party the way to Vraath Keep though he warned that it had become haunted.

Wasting little time the party followed Jorr back along the Witch Trail to the Dawn Way. From their they headed north across the causeway with surprisingly little incident. Soon they came to the foot of a hill that lead up to Vraath Keep. It was getting dark and many in the party were getting very sleepy so the group elected to camp for the night off the road.

## Storming Da Castle
With their much-needed shuteye the group woke up with the sun and stormed da castle. Ascending the hill brought the keep into view. The place had clearly seen better days. Giant boulders and the littered skeletons of giants told of the keep's fateful end.

A rickety gardening shack sat outside the keep's walls and seemed like a good enough place to start exploring. {{ mr_fabulous }} ventured inside to find what treasure there might be to be found. All he encountered was rusty gardening implements and decades old bags of manure. The disturbance caused by his presence was too much for the exhausted shack and it came crashing down in a furious discord.

The cacophony brought the attention of several goblin worg riders from just inside the keep. {{ oren }}, quick on his stubby feet, threw up a concealing mist that managed to obfuscate the party's presence. The worg riders were not completely satisfied so they began to patrol the perimeter. Realizing that a confrontation was inevitable the party set an ambush for the greenskins. With a flurry of blades, fire blasts and arrows the party made quick work of the patrolling guards and their canine mounts. At one point {{ zevy }} cleaved his axe from goblin head through worg tail. {{ stormy }} lifted another rider out of his saddle with three rapid shots.

With the immediate threat subdued the party made their way in towards their goal. With increased caution our heroes investigated the courtyard of the keep and the stables but found nothing of interest. A wary listen at the door in the southeast followed by a timid peek revealed a manticore resting on a nest of bones. Deciding it was best to let sleeping dogs lie the party carefully shut the door and continued their search.

Further exploration of the grounds found what the occupying force had made into a barracks. Several hobgoblins, some sleeping, were shacked up in a modified sleeping quarters. The hobgoblins had apparently not been alerted to the party's presence. {{ mr_fabulous }} taking full advantage of their surprise managed to dispatch two sleeping hobbos before the others noticed. The rest of the party joined the battle with their usual ferocity and quickly reduced the hobgoblins' numbers. The playing field was leveled as reinforcements lead by a charging minotaur burst forth from an inner room. With some lucky strikes and a few close calls the new combatants were cut down.

Sensing their proximity to the keep's closely guarded inner sanctum the party pressed on without pause. Continuing into the keep placed the party face to face with Koth, a bugbear sorcerer, and his minotaur right hand. {{ killian }} opened with an explosive fireball that shook the tower. Koth responded with a lightning bolt that wracked several party members with searing pain. Following the electric bolt came the charging minotaur with goring horns lowered. In a battle that pushed the party to their limits Koth and his minotaur minion were dispatched.

The party did not make it through the encounter unscathed. The evil sorcerer put {{ killian }} out of commission with a blinding spell. Everyone assumed the effect would wear off with time but it eventually took {{ oren }}'s divine skills to restore his sight.

Searching Koth's quarters and the rest of the tower yielded some significant [loot]({{site.baseurl}}/loot/) including a [Map of Koth's invasion plan](/img/KothsMap.jpg) and a [Staff of Life](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/staffs.htm#life) with 7 charges.

## The Manticore Remains
As the party is making their exit from the keep they discover that the manticore they had previously observed has moved from his nest and is perched on top of the keep's outer wall. The manticore is intelligent enough to know that his employer has just been slain and has no real desire for a direct confrontation. He demands that the party leave what he considers his home and brandishes his tail spikes to show his intentions of violence should the party fail to acquiesce. They acquiesce.

# Session Wrap-Up
For their valiant deeds and stalwart control over their bowels and bladders during combat {{ killian }}, {{ oren }}, {{ stormy }}, {{ mr_fabulous }} and {{ jeff }} attained level 7!
